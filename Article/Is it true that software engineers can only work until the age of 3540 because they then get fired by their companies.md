It is about half true.

In most industries, you reach your peak responsibility and peak inflation-adjusted pay rate during the year you turn 41. After that, on average, you earn less, and may face layoffs.

In the software biz, what happens is that most companies don’t last 50 years, or 30, or 20. There’s also a recession every 7 years or so, and if you’re not on a project, you can be laid off even if you’re great. When you’re young, you get laid off, but you immediately find a new job, because you’re the most employable person you know. Then some time after your 40th year, it begins to get a lot harder.

Staying current with all the whizzy new stuff will get you new intermediate-level jobs, but it’s hard to get senior level jobs because those spots are already filled with the guys who were luckier than you and didn’t get laid off. These in-house staff are graduates of a 25-year experiential cage-fight. They are pretty freakin’ good, and it’s what companies compare you against. Companies don’t like to hire senior staff because they are expensive. They expect an eye-popping degree of expertise from you.

Eventually you realize that the field of software development is *actually different* to the environment in which you gained all your experience. You’re just as smart as you ever were. In fact you’re a better coder than you were last year. Problem is, the jobs stop *feeling* right. If you lived frugally or got really lucky at some startup, you have enough money to retire in your mid-fifties. If you tried to live in San Francisco, you may not be able to retire.

So, get lucky and have a company that doesn’t get shot out from under you, and that doesn’t let you go to make the books look better for a single quarter, and you’re a god. Get unlucky, and you may find that you are hard to employ.
