[Was Facebook’s bet on HTML5 before they built React a mistake?](https://www.quora.com/Was-Facebook-s-bet-on-HTML5-before-they-built-React-a-mistake)

In the early 2010s, Facebook bet on implementing its iOS / Android app in mobile web versus native apps. And sure, it also didn’t have React.

It very publicly reversed course and reimplemented these apps natively. That was a significant endeavor at the time the company wasn’t very big.

The reason is because the performance of native apps was much higher than mobile web. Even if the mobile web apps had used React, the performance gap would still have been significant. I’m actually not sure hypothetical React mobile apps would have been any more performant back then.

It’s fair to say that Facebook bet on building the flagship apps with mobile web was a mistake but I don’t think that React would have changed anything.
