# Where do old programmers go?

Old programmer here.

I’m 57 and haven’t worked professionally as a programmer since I was 43. Some time after the dotcom boom and bust, employment agencies in the U.K. decided that programming was a graduate profession. Since I trained as a COBOL programmer on the job in the late Seventies, and attended night school to get a fairly worthless diploma, and dispensed with getting an undergraduate degree, I was suddenly persona non grata, and my curriculum vitae got stored in the bin.

So now I work as an administrative assistant for a charity, and attend a local college of further education to get a more useful diploma and retrain as a healthcare support assistant. It’s strange how things turn out, and certainly not what I expected when I started programming in 1978.

If I were you I wouldn’t give up just yet, especially if you have a degree and relevant experience. However, I understand that it’s disappointing to work in an unrelated field, having worked as a shop assistant and taking phone calls in a call centre.

I will finish with my only programming joke:

What’s the difference between an old programmer and an old dog? You *can* teach an old dog new tricks.
