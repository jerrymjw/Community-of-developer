Front-end development is NOT for everyone.

Considering the person doesn’t aim to be an average developer. Here’s why:

- Front-end development requires writing code which needs to work on multiple different devices varied by size, performance, capabilities and human interaction. Each of these devices can run interpret your code in multiple browsers with inconsistent rendering engines. The devices you need to support are constantly evolving and changing.
- It looks easy at the beginning but getting really hard on a professional level. To master it, you need to have a certain amount of knowledge about networking, dev ops, automation, testing, various programming concepts, security, SEO, user experience design, software architecture, performance optimization, asset optimization, analytics and so on.
- Programming only is enough to be an average front-end developer. You need have an eye for aesthetics, understand composition and motion concepts and know at least basics about colors. Good knowledge of web typography is a must.
- You need to be good at communicating with people and understanding their needs. About 20% of the time.

I’d say front-end is for the more adventurous and impulsive people. You need to embrace change and adapt quickly, while still loving order and logic.
