# If programming languages had honest titles, what would they be?

[If programming languages had honest titles, what would they be?](https://www.quora.com/If-programming-languages-had-honest-titles-what-would-they-be)

- C: The Boring (and Probably Correct) Choice
- C++: You Thought It Was Complicated BEFORE
- Objective-C: Now With Even More Confusing Syntax!
- C#: You'll Swear It's Not Java
- Swift: You'll Swear It's Not JavaScript
- Java: The Practical Choice of Middleware Developers the World Over‚Ä¶ And It's ALL Middleware.
- Java: (Re)Write Once (Every Major Version), Pray Your Containers Still Work.
- Ruby: Because Programs Should Be Fun, Not Efficient! (_why be efficient when you CAN BE inefficient?)
- Ruby: The best of Perl shoe-horned into SmallTalk! What could go wrong?
- Groovy: Easier than getting Ruby to work in the JVM? When you want Rails but can't quit Java‚Ä¶
- SmallTalk: Passing messages with class since 1972‚Ä¶ Basically ‚ÄúThat 70s Show‚Äù for programming.
- Python: Including ALL THE BATTERIES (You'll Never Need) Since 1991
- Python: Because you shouldn't have to pick between functional, procedural, and object-oriented style‚Ä¶ in the same file.
- PHP: Wait, you put HTML, CSS and SQL in here? And we installed this everywhere?
- PHP: How To Build The Internet in 30 Days or Less‚Ä¶ Pocket Edition‚Ä¶ for Dummies‚Ä¶ with root.
- JavaScript: Wait, you put HTML, CSS and SQL in here? Again? And installed it everywhere? Literally EVERYWHERE?
- JavaScript: Single-threaded, natively asynchronous, designed in a week, revised by committee, installed on every modern computer. What could go‚Ä¶ Await for it‚Ä¶ Promise it's worth it‚Ä¶
- Go: Do you like prioritizing type and thread safety over readability as much as Google does? We sure hope so!
- Go: More curly braces than you can shake your parentheses at!
- Rust: Well, it ain't Go! Way easier than C but still with all the comforting syntax errors you love.
- Dart: Look, JavaScript is hard to kill, but there are a LOT of Googlers, get it?
- Typescript: The Java-developer's JavaScript. Now with fewer foot-guns! (Now they're compiler errors‚Ä¶!)
- Elm: Is this like Lisp or‚Ä¶ or not? Is that HTML? Are those leading commas‚Ä¶?
- Clojure: The Gentleman's Lisp. An elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
- Clojure: Powering the fastest Middleware ever developed‚Ä¶ on the JVM‚Ä¶ Since no one uses Scheme.
- Scheme: Lisp for the 90s. Kinda cool once‚Ä¶ like Friends!
- Erlang: This runs where?
- Perl: Slightly overused scripting language for free to a good home. Written once, never debugged.
- Haskell: The Terminal Conclusion of Type Safety as a Design Principle. MONADS EVERYWHERE!
- Haskel: Useful, well-documented primer for Typescript.
- Elixir: What if Ruby took over Haskell and made it run Erlang? That's cool, right?
- Prolog: You OR I may not understand enough to get OR write this title, but with enough input it will work itself out.
- Kotlin‚Ä¶
- Updated when I think of more languages‚Ä¶ üòã
