Not a chance in hell, but don’t let that stop you from learning it!

React touched on something very important with its creation. I argue that what it realized was that web development was quickly becoming a world of JavaScript developers who just happen to develop for the web, as opposed to web developers who hand write HTML and CSS and then attach functionality to that with JQuery and JS. We are now pukka *developers*, and we need true development skill. The old days are done. Welcome to the brave new world.

AngularJS, on the other hand, came from those old days. AngularJS’s literal mission was to be an extension to HTML. It was rooted in the old, DOM-first perspective, and Angular is still influenced by that.

But, and this is a big but, Angular is now functionally far more like React than its interface would make it seem. As such, many of the deep insights that can be had from one actually apply to the other. So even if Angular dies, what you learn with it is valuable.

Now, I do not think Angular will die. In fact, I think Angular has a bright future ahead of it because Google will force it so, and Google has a lot of money and influence. Angular is iterating a truly stunning pace, and the framework is getting better with every release.

Furthermore, Google is pushing Angular hard into the corporate world because its interface is very familiar to those raised on MVC-style systems, and its use of TypeScript is familiar to those accustomed to typed languages like C#. That makes Angular attractive, and based on my experience in the corporate world today, I can say with great assuredness that Angular uptake is growing rapidly. Your knowledge in Angular will a*lways* be sellable.
