# Why is ReactJS so popular?

[Why is ReactJS so popular?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-ReactJS-so-popular)

ReactJS is popular for 3 reasons. You take any one of those reasons away and it doesn’t get popular.

So here are the three big reasons…

1. **It was made by Facebook.**
2. **It solves for SPAs.**
3. **Because it’s popular.**

When ReactJS came out the most important reason that anyone cared is because Facebook made it. That gave it what Dr. Robert Chialdini calls “social proof”.

Facebook is one of the most important and valuable technology companies, so if it’s good enough for Facebook, a lot of other people will trust it (even if it sucks). This is one of the oldest and most important reasons for technology popularity. As the old saying goes…

“Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.”

That was a real thing in the tech world for decades. Social proof.

So, Facebook makes ReactJS and it takes off like crazy because Facebook was using it!

If I had created ReactJS and launched it on my blog, nobody would have cared or used it. So, you don’t get ReactJS popular without it coming from Facebook.

That’s step one…

Step two is that it solved some major issues for SPAs (Single Page Applications).

At the time React came out, SPAs were the hot new thing because of backbone.js and Angular. I worked on some early SPAs and it became clear just how much of a mess they were.

ReactJS was a step forward at the right time. It organized some of the mess and people liked it.

You put out React at a different time, say 7 years before and it would have been a dud. Nobody was writing SPAs back then really and so it would have been a nothingburger type project. Maybe some cool bit of internal R&D or whatever.

But fixing Single Page JS Apps was a huge deal at the time. Still is I guess.

Which leads us to step three…

It’s now popular because it’s popular.

It’s the new jQuery. People now use ReactJS because other people use React and that kind of circular reasoning is good enough to keep it popular for a good long time.

React is now being used where it shouldn’t be and will be applied to things where isn’t not a good solution simply because everyone is using it and since it’s so good at one thing, it might as well be used for all the things right?!

Anyway, popularity has a network effect that creates more popularity. Once it hit a certain tipping point, React started to “eat the world”.

The most ironic part of all of this is that when it comes down to technical merits, React isn’t popular because of the technology. It is popular because of social proof, timing, and network effects. There are/were other technologies that could have been React and didn’t get big.

So, it’s important to realize that we are people are the reasons we do things rarely have anything to do with technology, even in the technology world. Go figure!

Except that Angular was created and is supported by even larger technology beast ‘Google’, but still inferior to Reactjs when it comes to the mechanisms behind the two frameworks ‘React is not a framework tho but well..’.

I mean, I see that all the reasons you’ve just mentioned have actually nothing to do with the truth behind React popularity and no offense.

But yep, React is popular for technical, performance and architectural reasons. The Virtual DOM is just a great way of handling DOM manipulations, the idea of only updating the diff is just greaaat when you come to talk about performance. Also, one of the main reasons why React is popular is ‘its flexibility’, meaning, React -as I mentioned- is mainly a JS library not a framework, that fact gives us ‘developers’ the freedom and flexibility to include and import whatsoever third-party plugin or library within the application, the idea is customizing the application and enhancing it with whatever library or code you would like is just awesome.

Angular is just restricting you to certain pattern and architecture which is utterly lame if you ask me, that’s not the case with React.

The example you just gave about Facebook creating React vs you on your blog is pretty misleading, as it’s not actually about Facebook ‘**as a brand**’ no! But about **FACEBOOK DEVELOPERS AS REALLY QUALIFIED ONES**. I’m saying that with knowing some of them that participated in React production.

So yeah, Facebook created React and **USED IT**, which is quite an evidence to its robustness, reliability and performance
