# Are HTML and CSS still worth learning in 2021?

Over the past year there has been some radical changes in web standards.

A lot of developers still believe that the web is just an endless combination of <div> elements that can be styled inline. That approach, which had been popularized by the early versions of React, puts the brunt of the business logic in the javascript code. However, with recent improvements, it is possible to shift a large part of the business logic of an app to templating and styling (so HTML and CSS). For instance, it’s possible to implement a dark mode for an app without writing a line of javascript, and it’s arguably the right way to do so. Likewise, there’s an increasingly large number of moderately complex UI interactions that could be entirely done in HTML/CSS.

Somebody that doesn’t keep close tabs on HTML and CSS will find writing modern front end code harder and harder.
