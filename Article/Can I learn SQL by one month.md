You can learn SQL in a month. You only need a few days to learn the basics of this language.

As soon as you start learning, you will see that SQL is based on logical syntax and the English language. There are no strange stamps and numbers here, such as in Java or C +.

Here you just write a SQL statement in which you specify what data you want to get. You don't need to know how it will happen that you will get this result, the database will do everything itself.
