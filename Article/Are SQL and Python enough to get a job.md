For what role?

There are people called SQL developers earning 150K and all they do is write SQL code.

There are developers at Google earning 300K on the Tensorflow team and all they do is author Python code.

If you’re asking, is SQL and Python enough to get a job as a machine learning engineer then that answer is hell no.

Companies aren’t handing out 300K salaries because you know some basic SQL and Python. Sorry, not how the real-world works.

Machine learning is one of the most technical jobs in the world and if you want a crazy salary, you’ll need crazy skills.
