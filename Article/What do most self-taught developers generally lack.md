# What do most self-taught developers generally lack?

The thing that I’ve noticed — and realize, even though I went to college, most of what I know is because I am an autodidact, much worse than most self-taught (autodidactic) software engineers with no college) is a lack of depth.

I passed the GED at 13 — 7th grade — but didn’t submit the paperwork, because I wanted to spend time reading instead. When you memorize two entire encyclopedias and an unabridged OED while working one period a day as a library aide, between shelving returned books, it’s not a hard thing to do.

I didn’t learn to develop depth uniformly, until my third year in college, when a physics PhD made me put a problem from our homework up on the board, near the start of class.

Until then, I had been coasting, because I could coast.

I read the textbook cover to cover as soon as they handed them out, and a week later, I was more or less done: I knew everything in the book. It helps to have a personal autobiographical eidetic memory. I never failed a history test in my life. I pointed out a contradiction with what the professor was saying in class, and Halliday and Resnik on page 453 of the textbook he was using.

Homework was handed in at the end of class, so I could do it in class, while the teacher lectured on things I had already read, and I never took homework home and did it at home, until my third year in college, because it didn’t impact my learning, and I could do it.

Until I couldn’t.

Because of Dr. Tripp making me put that homework problem up on the board. At the beginning of class, before I had done my homework in class.

I solved it, but it was obvious I hadn’t done my homework at home, the night before, and that I was spending zero time outside of class, on the class. He held me back after class. And I recited, verbatim, an entire chapter of the analytical mechanics textbook to him, wen he asked me to, to prove it.

If you are an autodidact, you will have great depth in the things you find interesting, and almost no depth at all in the things that you don’t find interesting.

Depth, but no breadth, unless someone forces you to develop it.

I hated Dr. Tripp at the time, but he was probably one of the most positively influential people in my life. To this day.

You probably won’t understand what a lack of breadth will mean to your career. I didn’t, but I was lucky, because I found Knuth’s books fascinating. So my interests aligned, moving forward, with what happened to be a success strategy.

If you don’t have an interest there, or some place similar, it means you will be strongly unsuited to working on teams.

If you are self-taught, you probably do not know the names by which algorithms are called, and you probably don’t know what “Big O notation” implies.

You can’t talk jargon. You can’t communicate effectively on teams.

If you can’t talk jargon, you will be a drag on the team, no matter how brilliant you are otherwise.

It’s one of those areas where depth is important. And you don’t get to know what’s important ahead of time.

People who can do these things?

They should not be in charge of what they spend their time on, until they learn the above lessons.
