The quickest way to becoming a Front End Developer:1. Learn HTML (1 - 2 weeks)2. Learn CSS (1 - 2 weeks)3. Learn JavaScript (2 - 4 weeks)HTML and CSS for visual displays (what the user sees) and JavaScript for advanced user or page interaction (do things when a user does something).I believe one can call themselves a Front End Developer after completing these 3 steps. If just starting out, itâ€™s ok to double or triple the average time completion range.
