*Data Analyst* is one of those titles whose responsibilities vary from company to company. Much like *Business Analyst*, *BI Specialist*, and even *Data Scientist*, it depends on the company’s expectations of the work involved.

That said, I would say that **generally speaking**, knowing SQL and Tableau would be enough to get you a job.

I know of a Fortune 500 whose data analysts use Tableau and aren’t even expected to know SQL. Conversely, my current company expects not only SQL, but some exposure to management tools like ETL, StreamSets, etc. Compare that to my previous employer where expectations involved the knowledge of and capability to perform certain statistical analyses.

Having a couple of specific tools in your arsenal is great, but like the other job titles whose responsibilities vary from company to company, it’s always better to know more.
