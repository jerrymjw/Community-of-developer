Because 99% of the time when someone identifies as a front-end developer they are saying that they have not been a developer for very long.

Think of it this way. On the web, Ajax was “invented” in 2004 (actually Outlook was doing it in 1999 but shh…we can’t give Microsoft any credit). It did not become a central part of most web developers’ lives till 2008/2009 or so. Even then, Javascript was avoided by many until frameworks started coming out in the early 2010s.

So what were people who were already established developers pre-2010 doing? Working largely on the back-end. So now that they do a lot of front-end work too, they face the choice, do they brand themselves as a “front-end” or a “full-stack” developer? I certainly choose the latter.

Which leaves most people who embrace the “front-end” moniker as people who have been coding professionally for less than six years. So yeah…they’re less sure of themselves.

For the record, I use the “front-end” and “back-end” terms above in the manner I see them used more often, with “back-end” meaning server-based languages, databases, etc; and “front-end” meaning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Personally I dislike those definitions and prefer “back-end developer” to indicate how good someone is at understanding architecture, performance, databases, and security; and “front-end developer” to indicate to what degree someone thinks about human-computer interaction, responsiveness, UI optimization and reusability, browsers, responsiveness, and accessibility. When you formulate definitions this way you start seeing these as two largely orthogonal dimensions of a square, rather than anything mutually exclusive.
