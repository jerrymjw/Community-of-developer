They aren’t called engineers, they are called DBAs.

You can’t find a top tier DBA these days.

I made a career of coming behind DBAs that had very basic skills and fixing the trouble their lack of knowledge and in-experienced caused.

The top job right now is the data engineer. It’s actually the top job on earth.

If I were starting out now, my focus would be on data engineering. This role works with structured and non-structured data stores.
