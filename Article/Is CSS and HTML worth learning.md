# Is CSS and HTML worth learning?

For a few years, HTML and CSS were the cornerstone of the web. Everything lived to present HTML. CSS was then used to style it. JavaScript existed, and so did a few other server-side languages, and people would learn them in small doses in order to present HTML. Over time, we opted to complicate things by adding layers of things that seem to make HTML and CSS unimportant or outdated. But the truth is, both HTML and CSS are still progressing and have really neat things to offer that only Flash used to accomplish. During the day I’m called a “Front-End Developer”, and my clients often hire me to work on AngularJS or React projects. But the truth is, a good percentage of my time is actually spent on HTML and CSS, because that’s the focal point. That’s where people meet your app or site. When those other frameworks render their work, the result is HTML. When someone has a WordPress site that they need built, most don’t yell, “look at that beautiful WordPress-focused PHP!” The end result is still HTML and CSS. If you go down the path of learning HTML and CSS, there will be many things that show up to distract you. But it always comes back to those two things.
