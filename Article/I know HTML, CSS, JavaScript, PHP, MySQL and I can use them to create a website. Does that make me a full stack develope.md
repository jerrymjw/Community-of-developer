It means that you can develop a full stack - but whether you’re good enough at it to get a job doing it - is a different matter.

There is a world of difference between writing something for yourself and writing something to a specification that you did not create.

Then there is the matter of how readable and maintainable your code is by others - and how well you can read and maintain code that other people wrote.

It’s really hard to say how well a self-taught person can do in the business world.

One suggestion I often offer is to find an OpenSource project that’s doing the stuff that you do. Offer to help, pick up one of their bug reports and see if you can fix their problem. Get your code peer-reviewed by others. If you can manage THAT effectively, then - yeah, by all means call yourself a Full Stack Developer - and produce the proof of that with all of your commits to a reasonably well-known project.
