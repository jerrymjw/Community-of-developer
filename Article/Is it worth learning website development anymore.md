[Is it worth learning website development anymore? There are so many tools that allow people to generate websites like Wix, WordPress, site builders, etc.](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-learning-website-development-anymore-There-are-so-many-tools-that-allow-people-to-generate-websites-like-Wix-WordPress-site-builders-etc)

Nope. Don’t do it. Go find another career. Nothing to see here! Web development is dead.

*drives away any potential competition and keeps all the clients* Bwahahaa.

Really, those auto-builders are for people who aren’t looking for a quality, professional site. They are looking for some way to get a basic web presence without spending any money. As a result, their businesses frequently suffer because those sites invariably look amateur.

These people would never have hired a developer even before these things came out, They would have asked for a quote, and then when given a number, said, “Haha, my cousin’s nephew’s dog said he would make me one for free!” - true story. It happened to me.

In reference to WordPress, I am speaking only about premade themes that are “plug and play”. People tend to install these and add a crap-ton of plugins and the site just ends up looking junky.

A properly developed Wordpres site, however, looks so good you would never guess it was WordPress.
