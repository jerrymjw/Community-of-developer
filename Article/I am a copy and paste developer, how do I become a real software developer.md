[I am a copy and paste developer, how do I become a real software developer?](https://www.quora.com/I-am-a-copy-and-paste-developer-how-do-I-become-a-real-software-developer)

I have been working in a professional environment since July 2017. Here is what I have observed:

My superiors don’t expect me to write every single line of code from scratch all the time. In fact they tell me to go and look at a particular application’s code and do exactly what that module is doing in that specific application. Sometimes I do have to write a lot of code from scratch if it is a brand new functionality that we are building. In fact I have had to design entire modules that perform a specific task. I have always been encouraged to make the modules as portable as possible so that the code can be recycled in other applications if needed.

I go and look at that application and try to understand what that code is doing. Then I replicate the same functionality but I also watch out for scenarios that might need to be modified in my application. Therefore I do quite a lot of copy-pasting (up to 70–80% sometimes). The problem is not copy-pasting. The problem is do you understand what that piece of code is trying to accomplish? Don’t blindly copy-paste.

Real software developers don’t re-invent the wheel every time they are coding.

P.S.
If you copy from anywhere make sure you put the source of the code in the comments. This helps you in future when you are trying to determine where you got this code from as well as it helps you from committing plagiarism.
