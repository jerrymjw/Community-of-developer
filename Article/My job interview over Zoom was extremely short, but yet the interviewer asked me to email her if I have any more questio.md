# My job interview over Zoom was extremely short, but yet the interviewer asked me to email her if I have any more questions. Is that a good sign?

you didn’t get the job. sorry.

i’ve been on sooooooooooo many interviews that i know when i didn’t get the job by the end of the interview, and this is a clear cut “no”

very short interviews normally mean you didn’t get the job. probably 80% of the time an interview is very short, you didn’t get it. the other 20% tend to be seasonal jobs only (temporary) where they don’t really care how great you are, they just need bodies to do the excess work.

also, if they don’t tell you that THEY will phone you in the next few days to let you know, rather than telling you to email them, it’s a bad sign.

a good sign would be if they asked you if you were able to start on a certain date if you were hired.

keep trying

UPDATE: just got a message that my answer has been shown to 5 million people and i have to laugh. it’s a simple, mediocre answer and i have so many other answers that are so much better, and with those, i get 1 or 2 upvotes, if any. i will never understand people.
